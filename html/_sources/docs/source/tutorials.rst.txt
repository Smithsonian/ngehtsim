Generate an EHT-like dataset
===============================

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a globe-spanning network of radio dishes that is most well-known for having gathered the data that were used to reconstruct the first image of the supermassive black hole in the heart of the M87 galaxy [#EHTM874]_.  The original EHT observations took place in April 2017 [#EHTM873]_, using an array that consisted of 7 distinct radio facilities: `ALMA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Large_Millimeter_Array>`_, `APEX <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Pathfinder_Experiment>`_, `IRAM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAM_30m_telescope>`_, `JCMT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell_Telescope>`_, `LMT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Millimeter_Telescope>`_, `SMA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submillimeter_Array>`_, and `SMT <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz_Submillimeter_Telescope>`_ [#EHTM872]_.  In this tutorial, we will generate synthetic data that attempt to emulate the 2017 EHT observations of M87.
