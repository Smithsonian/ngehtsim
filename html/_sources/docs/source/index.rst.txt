Welcome to ngehtsim's documentation!
====================================

ngehtsim is a set of Python_ tools for generating synthetic data appropriate for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) facilities operating at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT_) and the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT_).  ngehtsim builds on synthetic data generation capabilities contained in the ehtim_ library, primarily by adding utilities for incorporating local weather effects, telescope properties, and fringe-finding proxies to the data generation procedure.  Atmospheric state data for ngehtsim comes from the `MERRA-2`_ database, processed through the am_ radiative transfer code to produce optical depth and brightness temperature information.
